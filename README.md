# maxcaldiffmap
A maximum entropy approach to diffusion maps

This repository contains scripts required to obtain constrained Markov chains and their consequent application in dimensionality reduction approaches. 

There are four examples: 
1) Diffusion map analysis of two planes embedded in a high dimensional space (artificial data)
2) Diffusion map analysis of mouse hematopoietic cell differentiation trajectory
3) Laplacian eigenmap analysis of TCGA data
4) tSNE analysis of MNIST data
